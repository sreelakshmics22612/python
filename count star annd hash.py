"""/* * Given a string S(input consisting) of ‘*’ and ‘#’. The length of the string is variable. The task is to find the minimum number of ‘*’ or ‘#’ to make it a valid string. The string is considered valid if the number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ are equal. The ‘*’ and ‘#’ can be at any position in the string. Note : The output will be a positive or negative integer based on number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ in the input string. ● (*>#): positive integer ● (#>*): negative integer ● (#=*): 0 """
